#### Current Research Interests: 

On the unification of System Identification, Control, Optimization and Machine Learning with applications to the understanding and (re-)design of natural and man-made systems. In particular, I have been focusing on applications such as biology, robotics and power systems. 


#### Testbed in my lab:

Quadrotors (Vicon Motion Capture System, Crazyflie 2.0)

Robots (UR3, Kinect)

Hypersim 

GPU cluster (Nvidia 1080)

#### Group at Huazhong UST: 

Postdocs: Xiuting Li (PhD Maths Hust, 2016-)

PhDs: Ruijuan Chen, Zuowei Ping, Yunlong Dong, Guijun Ma, Junlin Li, Xiuchuan Tang

Masters: Minglu Li, Xiaoquan Tang, Xiangdi Liu, Beitong Zhou, Guorui Shen, Jingjing Hong, Xueqi Dai

Long-term Visitors: Prof. Tao Yang(6.2017 - 7.2017, UNT), Prof. Jun Liu (5.2017 - 6.2017, Waterloo), Frank Jiang (9.2016 - 10.2016, UC Berkeley), Dr. Wei Pan (8.2016 - 9.2016, Imperial College)

#### Group Alumni: (and where they are now.)

Class of 2017: Xuejun Wang (CMU), Yuzhen Liu(Tsinghua), Jiazhou Qin(UCSD), Haowei Xiang(Umich)
